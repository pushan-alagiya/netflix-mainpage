# Netflix Clone

A Netflix Clone project that replicates the popular streaming service's user interface. It's built using React, React-Youtube, Axios, and utilizes the TMDB API for fetching movie data. The Movie Trailer library is used to display trailers. This project started two months ago with the development of the [landing page](https://github.com/pushan-alagiya/Netflix-Clone), and now it has progressed to the main page. While it currently showcases a UI and plays trailers from YouTube, plans are in place to implement a full backend soon.
